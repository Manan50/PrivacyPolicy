                  Manan P built the ViPlayer app. This App is provided by
                  Manan P at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is.

                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use my App.
                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use my App, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. The Information that I collect is
                  used for providing access to the App. I will not use or share your information with
                  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p>

                </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                  For a better experience, while using our App, I
                  may require you to provide us with certain personally
                  identifiable information. The information that
                  I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
                </p> <div><p>
                    The app does not use any third party Apps that may collect
                    information used to identify you.
                  </p> <p>

                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory.
                </p> <p>
                  This App does not use these “cookies” explicitly.

                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing us your
                  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
                </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <p>
                  These Apps do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                  I do not knowingly collect personally
                  identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                  me with personal information, I immediately
                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                  personal information, please contact me so that
                  I will be able to do necessary actions.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Privacy Policy from
                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I will
                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                  this page.
                </p> <p>This policy is effective as of 2022-06-15</p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>

                  Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at manan966@gmail.com.
